Property	Typical FAANG Assumption	Justification
Global traffic volume	~1–5 million requests per second (RPS) total	Common target for global systems
Active clients	~50 million users, many with multiple IPs	Realistic for a large-scale consumer product
Latency target	<10 ms P99 decision latency per region	Rate limiting must not block API flow
Availability target	≥99.99%	Must survive node and regional failures
Consistency model	Eventual consistency acceptable	Perfect sync not required for rate limits
Regions	3 regions (US-East, EU-West, AP-South)	Typical FAANG deployment footprint
Per-user rate limit example	100 requests per second	
Per-IP rate limit example	1000 requests per minute


Summary of realistic local testing envelope
Metric	Upper Limit (practical)
Requests/sec total	1 000
Redis ops/sec	10 000
Concurrent users (JMeter threads)	200
End-to-end latency	≤ 10 ms
Redis dataset	≤ 100 K keys

ignore caching rules for now
headers in repsonse
excessive requests are dropped

supports fixed window counter and token bucket



client -> rateLimit -> fetch rules if good process else returns 429 update redis counters
